Here's everything I did to set up this project thus far, so I can recreate it whenever necessary

Commands:
npm init (started node)
npm install express (parser)
npm install ejs (view engine)
npm heroku (yeah gonna have to look this one up)
npm pg (postgres for heroku)
(probably forgetting some, but I'll add to it. Or the issues will come up)


Make sure to create a heroku app AND database.
package.json needs a start script added in order to run

[heroku pg:psql postgresql-concentric-09360 --app cst438moviesnacks2]
^^ this command should run in terminal when accessing the database/heroku app
From there tables can be created, then accessed

Reference this project for how to set up favorite headers and ejs as a whole.
